### In-Memory Persistence
The In-Memory Persistence keeps the AAS and Submodel Registry in the local memory. At startup, the Registry always starts empty. All registered AASs or Submodels will be stored in the local memory. When the application is stopped, all registered AASs and Submodels will be lost.


The In Memory Persistence has no additional configuration parameters.
